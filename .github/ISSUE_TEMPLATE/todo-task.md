### Summary:
Start to pivot to using issues to track who is working on what. 

### Time frame?
We should be ready for a pivot to this and use for week 5. 

### Example Use Case

- In Monday stand-up, we can look at all the open issues, talk about ones that push us closer to our sprint goals, and make sure we have people assigned.
- In Wednesday stand-up, we can look at the milestone and see the open issues and the progress
- In Friday stand-up, we can look at the milestone and see how we did. 

### Related Issues:

- Issue #4 
- Issue #3 

### How to Test:
- Week five can be a good test to see how this "production feature" goes via the week 5 retrospective.
