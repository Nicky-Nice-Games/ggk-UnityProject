## Golisano Go-Karts

An Interactive Games & Media E CO-OP sponsored by: **Nicky Nice Games**

*It's an IGM themed Mario Kart - TAGLINE*

## Executive Summary

Our project is an arcade-style Kart Racer game that IGME students will be able to play in between their classes. This game will be iconic; that is to say students will be able to identify with the sort of vibe our game gives off. It will be reminiscent of R.I.T. themes, but will put a unique gamified twist on them to really capture the chaos and excitement of a Kart Racing game. This project, if successful, will lay the groundwork for future co-ops to be done in this same style.
